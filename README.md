This repository contains a bioinformatics project that focuses on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and functional variant effects analysis. The project includes a mini-GWAS to identify genetic associations with multifactorial phenotypes, particularly focusing on SNPs from various chromosomes. Additionally, the project predicts the functional impact of selected genetic variants, such as missense, nonsense, and regulatory variants, within a chosen gene. Using PLINK and other bioinformatics tools, the analysis explores the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. The results are interpreted in a manner accessible to non-genetics experts, making the findings easy to understand for a broader audience.
